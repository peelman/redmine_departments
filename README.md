#Redmine Departments Plugin
##About
We needed to be able to track Departments as a separate entity in Redmine, with more flexibility and power than adding Custom Attributes allowed for.  Thus, Redmine\_Departments was born.  You can track departments, as well as basic contact information for each department, and relate departments to issues (many/many relationship).
###Features
+ Permissions for Viewing, Creating, and Removing Departments
+ Permissions for Viewing, Creating, and Removing Issue->Department relationships

###Version
+ Currently at 1.0.1
+ Requires Redmine 0.9.x (built/tested on 0.9.6, untested on previous versions, but it should work...)
+ Due to a change in Redmine 1.0, Departments won't work without some tweaking.  See my cc\_addresses plugin for details, as it shares the same issue. (this has been fixed in Redmine, but I donâ€™t know what changes need to be made for _departments to work properly.
